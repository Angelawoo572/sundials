The texdoc.m script assumes use of the m2html package freely available at:
http://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/m2html/

To get started, the easiest thing is to download the package and install 
it in a matlab directory.

Then add two subdirectories in the m2html/templates directory titled:
latex
sundialsTB

Copy the files from 
sundials/sundialsTB/doc/tex_files/stb_template
into the m2html/templates/latex subdirectory

Copy the files from 
sundials/sundialsTB/doc/html_files/stb_template
into the m2html/templates/sundialsTB subdirectory

To run texdoc.m, start Matlab and at the Matlab prompt, add the m2html
location to the Matlab path by executing:
>> addpath ~\matlab\m2html
or with a similar specification of the location of the m2html package.

At this point, you should be able to execute texdoc.m
