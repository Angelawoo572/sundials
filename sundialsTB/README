                A MATLAB interface to SUNDIALS
                   Release 2.2.0, Month 2006

sundialsTB provides a MATLAB interface to two of the SUNDIALS solvers:
  CVODES: a variable-order, variable-step ODE solver with sensitivity 
          analysis capabilities
  KINSOL: a nonlinear system solver

The core of each MATLAB interface in sundialsTB is a single mex file 
which interfaces to the various user-callable functions for that solver. 
However, this mex file should not be called directly, but rather through 
the user-callable functions provided for each MATLAB interface.

The distribution file also contains a user guide (PDF and PS), as well 
as several examples. An HTML version of the documentation is available 
on the SUNDIALS website (www.llnl.gov/CASC/sundials)


+----------+
| REQUIRES |
+----------+

 - SUNDIALS v 2.2.0
 - Optionally, for parallel support, MPITB with LAM 7.1.1 (for MPI-2 features)


+---------+
| INSTALL |
+---------+

1. Choose ubication
-------------------

1.1. sundialsTB for all MATLAB users (not usual)
     Assume MATLAB is installed under $MATLAB=/usr/local/matlab7

     Place sundialsTB where toolboxes are usually stored:
     % cd /usr/local/matlab7/toolbox

1.2. sundialsTB for just one user (usual configuration)
 
     Place sundialsTB in your "matlab" working subdir:
     % cd ~/matlab

2. Decompress and untar
-----------------------

% tar zxvf <wherever>/sundialsTB.tar.gz

or

% cp <wherever>/sundialsTB.tar.gz
% gunzip sundialsTB.tar.gz
% tar xvf sundialsTB.tar
% rm sundialsTB.tar

Now there is a ~/matlab/sundialsTB (or $MATLAB/toolbox/sundialsTB) subdirectory.


3. Configuring MATLAB's startup
-------------------------------

sundialsTB comes with a startup_STB.m file in the top subdirectory

3.1. sundialsTB for all MATLAB users (not usual)
     Assume MATLAB is installed under $MATLAB=/usr/local/matlab7

     Add sundialsTB startup to the system-wide startup file

     % cd $MATLAB/toolbox/local
     % ln -s ../sundialsTB/startup_STB.m .

     and add these lines to your original local startup.m

     % SUNDIALS Toolbox startup M-file, if it exists.
     if exist('startup_STB','file')
        startup_STB
     end

3.2. sundialsTB for just one user (usual configuration)
     Assume you do not need to keep any previously existing startup.m

     % cd ~/matlab
     % ln -s sundialsTB/startup_STB.m startup.m

     If you already had a startup.m, use the method described above,
     first linking startup_STB.m to the destination subdir and then
     editing ~/matlab/startup.m to run startup_STB.m

4. Compiling MEX files
----------------------

To facilitate the compilation of sundialsTB on platforms that do not have
a make system, we rely on MATLAB's mex command. Compilation of sundialsTB
is done by running from under MATLAB the install_STB.m script which is
present in the sundialsTB top directory.

4.1. If you have not already done so, download and unpack SUNDIALS.
     Assume SUNDIALS is now located in /path/to/sundials

4.2. Launch matlab in sundialsTB:
     % cd $MATLAB/toolbox/sundialsTB
     % matlab
          or
     % cd ~/matlab/sundialsTB    
     % matlab

4.3. Run the install_STB matlab script.
     You will be asked for the location of the SUNDIALS source tree. 
     Input /path/to/sundials.

     Note that parallel support will be compiled into the MEX files only if
     ALL of the following conditions are met:
     - $LAMHOME is defined
     - $MPITB_ROOT is defined
     - /path/to/sundials/nvec_par exists 

5. Try one of the sundialsTB examples
-------------------------------------

If everything went fine, you should now be able to try one of the CVODES
or KINSOL examples (in matlab, type 'help cvodes' or 'help kinsol' to see
a list of all examples available):

5.1. cd to the CVODES serial example directory:
     % cd $MATLAB/toolbox/sundialsTB/cvodes/examples_ser
             or
     % cd ~/matlab/sundialsTB/cvodes/examples_ser
5.2. Launch matlab and execute cvdx
