\section{Applications}
\label{s:applications}

{\sf Do we want to keep this section as a section, or make part of intro or in the subsections on solvers?}

The following are brief descriptions of some of the major applications
of the SUNDIALS solvers that we have been involved with.

* Parallel CVODE is being used in a parallel 3D tokamak turbulence model in
LLNL's Magnetic Fusion Energy Division.  A typical run has 7 unknowns
on a $64 \times 64 \times 40$ mesh, with up to 60 processors.

* KINSOL with a HYPRE Multigrid preconditioner is being applied within
LLNL/CASC to solve a nonlinear Richards equation for pressures in
porous media flows.  Fully scalable solution performance obtained on
up to 225 processors of ASCI Blue.  SensKINSOL used to quantify
uncertainty in these groundwater problems.

* CVODE, KINSOL, IDA, with MG preconditioner, are being used to
solve 3D neutral particle transport problems within LLNL/CASC.
Scalable performance obtained on up to 5800 processors on ASCI Red.

* SensPVODE, SensKINSOL, and SensIDA have been used to determine
solution sensitivities of neutral particle transport applications at
LLNL w.r.t. various material properties, for solution uncertainty
quantification.

* IDA and SensIDA are being used in a cloud and aerosol microphysics
model at LLNL to study cloud formation processes, in study of model
parameter sensitivity.
