\section*{Abstract}

At LLNL's Center for Applied Scientific Computing, considerable
effort is devoted to mathematical software of a general purpose
nature, but with emphasis on large problems and parallel
environments.  This paper will describe a suite of solvers, all
written in ANSI C, but based on earlier Fortran solvers that have
been widely used.  All are suitable for both serial and parallel
machine environments.  CVODE is a solver for systems of ordinary
differential equations.  KINSOL is a solver for nonlinear
algebraic systems.  IDA is a solver for systems of
differential-algebraic equations.  Extensions to these solvers for
computation of sensitities will be discussed.
