\section{The Basic Solvers}\label{s:basic_solvers}

In this section we overview each of the three core solvers in SUNDIALS.
Although many of the same options are available in the three codes 
(e.g., finite-difference Jacobian-vector approximations 
and stopping criteria), we still outline them with respect to each package
as many of the hearistics governing their use or 
implementation are different.
