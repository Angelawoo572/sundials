\subsection{CVODE}

{\sf In this subsection, we need to include some information about the stability limit detection algorithms, cost, and performance.}

CVODE solves ODE initial value problems, which we write in the form
\[ \dot{y} = f(t,y),~~ y(t_0) = y_0,~~ y \in \mbox{\bf R}^N ~. \]

The methods used in CVODE are the following variable-order,
variable-step multistep methods:
\vspace*{-.19in}
\begin{itemize}
\item BDF = Backward Differentiation Formulas, in the so-called
fixed-leading coefficient form), suitable for stiff systems; and
\item Implicit Adams methods, suitable for nonstiff systems.
\end{itemize}

The multistep methods are implicit, and CVODE offers a choice of two
methods for solving the resulting nonlinear systems:
\vspace*{-.19in}
\begin{itemize}
\item Newton iteration, suitable in the stiff case, and
\item functional iteration, suitable in the nonstiff case.
\end{itemize}

In the stiff case, with Newton iteration specified, the linear systems
are solved by one of four methods:
\vspace*{-.19in}
\begin{itemize}
\item a dense direct solver (serial version only),
\item a band direct solver (serial version only),
\item a diagonal approximate Jacobian solver, or
\item SPGMR = Scaled Preconditioned GMRES, implemented in a
matrix-free manner, without restarts, with left and/or right
preconditioning, and requiring user routines for the preconditioning
setup and solve operations.

\end{itemize}

In the case of direct methods, the Jacobian may be supplied by a user
routine, or approximated by difference quotients.  In the case of
SPGMR, the user may supply a routine for the Jacobian-vector products,
or they will be approximated by matrix-free difference quotients.
