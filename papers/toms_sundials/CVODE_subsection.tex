\subsection{CVODE}\label{ss:cvode}

% What does CVODE do?
%--------------------
CVODE solves ODE initial value problems in real $N$-space, which we
write in the abstract form
\begin{equation}\label{ODE} 
  \dot{y} = f(t,y) \, ,\quad y(t_0) = y_0 \, ,
\end{equation}
where $y \in \mbox{\bf R}^N$.
Here we use $\dot{y}$ to denote $dy/dt$.  While we use $t$ to denote
the independent variable, and usually this is time, it certainly need
not be.  CVODE solves both stiff and nonstiff systems.  Roughly
speaking, stiffness is characterized by the presence of at least one
rapidly damped mode, whose time constant is small compared to the time
scale of the solution itself.

% Linear multistep methods
%-------------------------
The methods used in CVODE are variable-order, variable-step multistep
methods, based on formulas of the form
\begin{equation}\label{LMM} 
 \sum_{i = 0}^{K_1} \alpha_{n,i} y_{n-i} + 
     h_n \sum_{i = 0}^{K_2} \beta_{n,i} \dot{y}_{n-i} = 0 \, .
\end{equation}
Here the $y_n$ are computed approximations to $y(t_n)$, and
$h_n = t_n - t_{n-1}$ is the step size.  The user of CVODE must choose
appropriately one of two multistep methods: For nonstiff problems,
CVODE includes the Adams-Moulton formulas, characterized by $K_1 = 1$
and $K_2 = q$ above, where the order $q$ varies between $1$ and $12$.
For stiff problems, CVODE includes the Backward Differentiation
Formulas (BDFs) in so-called fixed-leading coefficient form, given by
$K_1 = q$ and $K_2 = 0$, with order $q$ varying between $1$ and $5$.
The coefficients are uniquely determined by the method type, its
order, the recent history of the stepsizes, and the normalization
$\alpha_{n,0} = -1$.

% Nonlinear system
%-----------------
For either choice of formula, the nonlinear system
\begin{equation}\label{NLS}
  G(y_n) \equiv y_n - h_n \beta_{n,0} f(t_n,y_n) - a_n = 0 \, ,
\end{equation}
where $a_n\equiv\sum_{i>0}(\alpha_{n,i}y_{n-i}+h_n\beta_{n,i}\dot{y}_{n-i})$, 
must be solved (approximately) at each time step.  For this, CVODE
offers the choice of either {\em functional iteration}, suitable only
for nonstiff systems, and various versions of {\em Newton iteration}.
Functional iteration, given by
\[ y_{n(m+1)} = h_n \beta_{n,0} f(t_n,y_{n(m)}) + a_n \, , \]
involves evaluations of $f$ only.  In contrast, Newton iteration requires
the solution of linear systems
\begin{equation}\label{Newtoncorr}
  M [y_{n(m+1)} - y_{n(m)}] = -G(y_{n(m)}) \, ,
\end{equation}
in which
\begin{equation}\label{Newtonmat} 
  M \approx I - \gamma J \, ,
  \quad J = \partial f / \partial y \, ,
  \quad \mbox{and} \quad
  \gamma = h_n \beta_{n,0} \, . 
\end{equation}
The initial guess for the iteration is a predicted value $y_{n(0)}$
computed explicitly from the available history data.
For the Newton corrections, CVODE provides a choice of four methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item a dense direct solver (serial version only),
\item a band direct solver (serial version only),
\item a diagonal approximate Jacobian solver, or
\item SPGMR = Scaled Preconditioned GMRES, without restarts.
\end{itemize}
For large stiff systems, where direct methods are not feasible, the
combination of a BDF integrator and a preconditioned GMRES algorithm
yields a powerful tool, because it combines established methods for
stiff integration, nonlinear iteration, and Krylov (linear) iteration
with a problem-specific treatment of the dominant source of stiffness,
in the form of the user-supplied preconditioner matrix \cite{BrHi:89}.

% WRMS Norm
%----------
In the process of controlling errors at various levels, CVODE uses a
weighted RMS norm, denoted $\|\cdot\|_{WRMS}$, for all error-like
quantities.  The weights used are based on the current solution and
on the relative and absolute tolerances input by the user, namely
\begin{equation}\label{errwt}
 W_i = rtol_i |y^i| + atol_i \, .
\end{equation}
Because $W_i$ represents a tolerance in the component $y^i$, a vector
whose norm is 1 is regarded as ``small''.  For brevity, we will
usually drop the subscript $WRMS$ on norms in what follows.

% Newton iteration
%-----------------
In the cases of a direct solver (dense, band, or diagonal), the
iteration is a Modified Newton iteration, in that the iteration matrix
$M$ is fixed throughout the nonlinear iterations.  However, for SPGMR,
it is an Inexact Newton iteration, in which $M$ is applied in a
matrix-free manner, with matrix-vector products $Jv$ obtained by
either difference quotients or a user-supplied routine.  The matrix
$M$ (direct cases) or preconditioner matrix $P$ (SPGMR case) is
updated as infrequently as possible, to balance the high costs of
matrix operations against other costs.  Specifically, this matrix
update occurs when:
\begin{itemize}
\item starting the problem,
\item more than 20 steps have been taken since the last update,
\item the value $\bar{\gamma}$ of $\gamma$ at the last update
satisfies $|\gamma/\bar{\gamma} - 1| > 0.3$,
\item a non-fatal convergence failure just occurred, or
\item an error test failure just occurred.
\end{itemize}
When forced by a convergence failure, an update of $M$ or $P$ may or
may not involve a re-evaluation of $J$ (in $M$) or of Jacobian data
(in $P$), depending on whether Jacobian error was the likely cause of
the failure.  More generally, the decision is made to re-evaluate $J$
(or instruct the user to re-evaluate Jacobian data in $P$) when:
\begin{itemize}
\item starting the problem,
\item more than 50 steps have been taken since the last evaluation,
\item a convergence failure occurred with an outdated matrix, and
the value $\bar{\gamma}$ of $\gamma$ at the last update
satisfies $|\gamma/\bar{\gamma} - 1| < 0.2$, or
\item a convergence failure occurred that forced a stepsize reduction.
\end{itemize}

% Newton convergence test
%------------------------
The stopping test for the Newton iteration is related to the
subsequent local error test, with the goal of keeping the nonlinear
iteration errors from interfering with local error control.  As
described below, the final computed value $y_n$ will have to satisfy a
local error test $\| y_n - y_{n(0)} \| \leq \epsilon$.  Here, we want
to insure that the iteration error $y_n - y_{n(m)}$ is small relative
to $\epsilon$, specifically that it is less than $0.1 \epsilon$.
(The safety factor $0.1$ can be changed by the user.)  For this, we
also estimate the linear convergence rate constant $R$ as follows:
We initialize $R$ to 1, and reset $R = 1$ when $M$ or $P$ is updated.
After computing a correction $\delta_m = y_{n(m)}-y_{n(m-1)}$, we
update $R$ if $m > 1$ as
\begin{equation*}
  R \leftarrow \max\{0.3R , \|\delta_m\| / \|\delta_{m-1}\| \} \, . 
\end{equation*}
Now we use the estimate
\begin{equation*}
  \| y_n - y_{n(m)} \| \approx \| y_{n(m+1)} - y_{n(m)} \| 
  \approx R \| y_{n(m)} - y_{n(m-1)} \|  =  R \|\delta_m \| \, . 
\end{equation*}
Therefore the convergence (stopping) test is 
\begin{equation*}
  R \|\delta_m \| < 0.1 \epsilon \, .
\end{equation*}
We allow at most 3 iteratations (but this limit can be changed by the
user).  We also declare the iteration diverged if any $\|\delta_m\| /
\|\delta_{m-1}\| > 2$ with $m > 1$. If convergence fails with $J$ or
$P$ current, we are forced to reduce the stepsize, and we replace
$h_n$ by $h_n/4$.  The integration is halted after a preset number
of convergence failures; the default value this limit is 10, 
but this can be changed by the user.

When SPGMR is used to solve the linear system, its errors must also be
controlled, and this also involves the local error test constant.  The
linear iteration error in the solution vector $\delta_m$ is
approximated by the preconditioned residual vector.  Thus to insure
(or attempt to insure) that the linear iteration errors do not
interfere with the nonlinear error and local integration error
controls, we require that the norm of the preconditioned residual
in SPGMR is less than $0.05 \cdot (0.1 \epsilon)$.

% Jacobian DQ approximations
%---------------------------
With the direct dense and band methods, the Jacobian may be supplied
by a user routine, or approximated by difference quotients,
at the user's option.  In the latter case, we use the usual
approximation
\[ J_{ij} = [f^i(t,y+\sigma_j e_j) - f^i(t,y)]/\sigma_j \, . \]
The increments $\sigma_j$ are given by
\[ \sigma_j = \max\left\{\sqrt{U} |y^j| , \sigma_0 W_j \right\} \, , \]
where $U$ is the unit roundoff, $\sigma_0$ is a dimensionless value,
and $W_j$ is the error weight of Eq. (\ref{errwt}).  In the dense
case, this scheme requires $N$ evaluations of $f$, one for each column
of $J$.  In the band case, the columns of $J$ are computed in groups,
by the Curtis-Powell-Reid algorithm, with a number of $f$ evaluations
equal to the bandwidth.

In the case of SPGMR, preconditioning may be used on the left, on the
right, or both, with user-supplied routines for the preconditioning
setup and solve operations, and optionally also for the matrix-vector
products $Jv$ required.  If a routine for $Jv$ is not supplied, these
products are computed as
\begin{equation}\label{jacobv}
Jv = [f(t,y+\sigma v) - f(t,y)]/\sigma \, . 
\end{equation}
The increment $\sigma$ is $1/\|v\|$, so that $\sigma v$ has norm 1.

% Error test
%-----------
A critical part of CVODE --- making it an ODE ``solver'' rather than
just an ODE method, is its control of local error.  At every step, the
local error is estimated and required to satisfy tolerance conditions,
and the step is redone with reduced stepsize whenever that error test
fails.  As with any linear multistep method, the local truncation
error LTE, at order $q$ and stepsize $h$, satisfies an asymptotic
relation
\[ LTE = C h^{q+1} y^{(q+1)} + O(h^{q+2} \]
for some constant $C$, under mild assumptions on the stepsizes.
A similar relation holds for the error in the predictor $y_{n(0)}$.
These are combined to get a relation
\[ LTE = C' [y_n - y_{n(0)}] + O(h^{q+2} \, . \]
The local error test is simply $\|LTE\| \leq 1$.  Using the above,
it is performed on the predictor-corrector difference 
$\Delta \equiv y_n - y_{n(0)}$ and takes the form
\[ \|\Delta_n\| \leq \epsilon \equiv 1/|C'| \, . \]
If this test passes, the step is considered successful.  If it fails,
the step is rejected and a new stepsize $h'$ is computed based on the
asymptotic behavior of the local error, namely by the equation
\[ (h'/h)^{q+1} \|\Delta_n\| = \epsilon/6 \, . \]
Here 1/6 is a safety factor.  A new attempt at the step is made,
and the error test repeated.  If it fails three times, the order $q$
is reset to 1 (if $q > 1$), or the step is restarted from scratch (if
$q = 1$).  The ratio $h'/h$ is limited below to .2 after two error test
failures and to .1 after three.  After seven failures, CVODE returns
to the user with a give-up message.

% Step/order control
%-------------------
In addition to adjusting the stepsize to meet the local error test,
CVODE periodically adjusts the order, with the goal of maximizing
stepsize.  The basic idea is to pick the order $q$ for which a
polynomial of order $q$ best fits the discrete data involved in the
multistep method.  However, if either a convergence failure or an
error test failure occurred on the step just completed, no change in
stepsize or order is done.  At the current order $q$, selecting a new
stepsize is done exactly as when the error test fails, giving a
tentative stepsize ratio
\[ h'/h = (\epsilon / 6 \|\Delta_n| )^{1/(q+1)} \equiv \eta_q \, . \]
We consider changing order only after taking $q+1$ steps at order $q$,
and then consider only orders $q' = q - 1$ (if $q > 1$) or
$q' = q + 1$ (if $q < 5$).  The local truncation error at order $q'$
is estimated using the history data.  Then a tentative stepsize ratio
is computed on the basis that this error, LTE$(q')$, behaves
asymptotically as $h^{q'+1}$.  With safety factors of 1/6 and
1/10 respectively, these ratios are:
\[ h'/h = [1 / 6 \|LTE(q-1)| ]^{1/q} \equiv \eta_{q-1} \]
and
\[ h'/h = [1 / 10 \|LTE(q+1)| ]^{1/(q+2)} \equiv \eta_{q+1} \, . \]
The new order and stepsize are then set according to
\[ \eta = \max\{\eta_{q-1},\eta_q,\eta_{q+1}\} ~,~~ h' = \eta h \, , \]
with $q'$ set to the index achieving the above maximum.
However, if we find that $\eta < 1.5$, we do not bother with the
change.  Also, $h'/h$ is always limited to 10, except on the first
step, when it is limited to $10^4$.

The various algorithmic features of CVODE described above, as
inherited from VODE and VODPK, are documented in \cite{BBH:89},
\cite{Byr:92}, and \cite{Hin:00}.  A full description of the usage
of CVODE is given in \cite{HiSe:03a}.

% Stability limit detection
%--------------------------
There is an important additional part of the CVODE order selection
algorithm that is not based on local error, but instead provides
protection against potentially unstable behavior of the BDF methods.
At order 1 or 2, the BDF method is A-stable.  But at orders 3 to 5 it
is not, and the region of instability includes a portion of the left
half-plane that is concentrated near the imaginary axis.  The size of
that region of instability grows as the order increases from 3 to 5.
What this means is that, when running BDF at these higher orders, if
an eigenvalue $\lambda$ of the system lies close enough to the
imaginary axis, the step sizes $h$ for which the method is stable are
limited (at least according to the linear stability theory) to a set
that prevents $h\lambda$ from leaving the stability region.  System
eigenvalues that are likely to cause this instability are ones that
correspond to weakly damped oscillations, such as might arise from a
semi-discretized advection-diffusion PDE with advection dominating
over diffusion.

CVODE includes an optional algorithm called STALD (STAbility Limit
Detection), which attempts to detect directly the presence of a
stability region boundary that is limiting the step sizes in the
presence of a weakly damped oscillation \cite{Hin:92}.  Working
directly with history data that is readily available, if it concludes
that the step size is in fact stability-limited, it dictates a
reduction in the method order, regardless of the outcome of the
error-based algorithm.  STALD has been tested in combination with the
VODE solver on linear advection-dominated advection-diffusion problems
\cite{Hin:95}, where it works well.  The implementation in CVODE has
been successfully tested on linear and nonlinear advection-diffusion
problems, among others.
The STALD option adds some overhead computational cost to the CVODE
solution.  In timing tests, these overhead costs have ranged from 2\%
to 7\% of the total, depending on the size and complexity of the
problem, with lower relative costs for larger problems.  Therefore, it
should be activated only when there is reasonable expectation of modes
in the user's system for which it is appropriate, together with poor
performance at orders 3-5, for no apparent reason, with the option
turned off.
