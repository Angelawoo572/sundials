\section{Introduction}

With the ever-increasing capabilities of modern computers, simulation 
code developers are challenged to develop fast and robust software 
capable of solving problems with increasingly higher resolutions and 
modeling more complex 
physical phenomena.  At the heart of many numerical simulation codes
lie systems of nonlinear algebraic or time-dependent equations, and 
simulation scientists continue to require efficient solvers for these 
systems.  

To meet this need, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory 
has a long history of research and development in ordinary
differential equation (ODE) methods and software, along with closely related
areas, with emphasis on applications to partial differential equations
(PDEs).  Among the popular Fortran solvers written at LLNL are the
following:
\begin{itemize}
\item VODE: a solver for ODE initial-value problems for stiff/nonstiff
systems, with direct solution of linear systems, by Brown, Byrne, and
Hindmarsh \cite{BBH:89}.
\item VODPK: a variant of VODE with preconditioned Krylov (GMRES
iteration) solution of the linear systems in place of direct methods,
by Brown, Byrne, and Hindmarsh \cite{Byr:92}.
\item NKSOL: a Newton-Krylov (GMRES) solver for nonlinear algebraic
systems, by Brown and Saad \cite{BrSa:90}.
\item DASPK: a solver for differential-algebraic equation (DAE)
systems (a variant of DASSL) with both direct and preconditioned
Krylov solution methods for the linear systems, by Brown, Hindmarsh,
and Petzold \cite{BHP:94}.
\end{itemize}
Starting in 1993, the push to solve large systems in parallel
motivated work to write or rewrite solvers in C.  The first result of
that effort was CVODE.  This was a rewrite in ANSI standard C of the
VODE and VODPK solvers combined, for serial machines
\cite{CoHi:94,CoHi:96}.  The next result of this effort was PVODE, a
parallel extension of CVODE \cite{ByHi:98,ByHi:99}.
Similar rewrites of NKSOL and DASPK followed, using the same
general design as CVODE and PVODE.  The resulting solvers are called
KINSOL and IDA, respectively.
More recently, we have merged the PVODE and CVODE codes into a 
single solver, CVODE, which runs in both serial and parallel environments. 

These codes have been combined into the core of SUNDIALS, the  
SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/Algebraic equation Solvers.  
This suite, consisting of CVODE, KINSOL, and IDA, augmented to include
forward and adjoint sensitivity 
analysis capabilities, was implemented with the goal of providing
robust time integrators and nonlinear solvers which can easily be 
incorporated into existing simulation codes.  The primary design 
goals were to require minimal information from the user, allow users 
to easily supply their own data structures underneath the solvers, 
and allow for easy incorporation of user-supplied linear solvers
and preconditioners.

As simulations have increased in size and complexity, the 
relationship between computed results and problem parameters has 
become harder to establish.  Scientists have a greater need to
understand answers to questions like: ``Which parameters are 
most influential?'', ``How can parameters be adjusted to better 
match experimental data?'', and ``What is the uncertainty in solutions 
given uncertainty in data?''  Sensitivity analysis provides 
information about the relationship between simulation results and model 
data which can be critical to answering these questions.  In addition, for 
a given parameter, sensitivities can be computed in a modest multiple of 
the computing time of the simulation itself.  
SUNDIALS is being expanded to 
include forward and adjoint sensitivity versions of the solvers.
The first of these, CVODES, is complete.  A brief description of the
strategy for adding sensitivity analysis in a way that respects the
user interfaces of the SUNDIALS codes is contained in this paper, and 
a more thorough description of the CVODES package is contained in a 
companion paper \cite{SeHi:03}.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.  In Section 
\ref{s:basic_solvers}, the algorithms contained in the three 
core solvers of SUNDIALS are presented.  
We have attempted to identify many of the heuristics related to 
stopping criteria and finite-difference parameter selection
where appropriate as these items 
can sometimes affect algorithm performance significantly.
In Section \ref{s:preconditioning}, the
preconditioning packages supplied with SUNDIALS are
described.  Section \ref{s:sensitivity_analysis} overviews
the CVODES package and strategies for adding sensitivity 
capabilities to the codes.  Sections \ref{s:organization} and 
\ref{s:usage} describe the organization of the codes within the 
suite and the philosophy of the user interface.   
Availability of the codes is given in 
Section \ref{s:availability}.  Finally, comments on 
applications of SUNDIALS, concluding remarks, and indications 
of future development
are contained in the last section.
