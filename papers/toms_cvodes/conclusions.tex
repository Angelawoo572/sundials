\section{Conclusions}\label{s:conclusions}

CVODES is the first in a series of new additions to SUNDIALS. The new codes,
IDAS and KINSOLS, together with CVODES will provide sensitivity analysis
for all the types of problems addressed by the basic SUNDIALS solvers.
These new capabilities....


Like all of SUNDIALS, CVODES is under active development. Future work includes...

- generation of the sensitivity equations (complex step - underway; incorporation
of AD tools as they become available - especially important for adj. sensi where
there is no other alternative to analytical formulas)

- incorporation of language interoperability capabilities (Babel)

- root-finding capabilities

- application in inversion and dynamically-constrained optimization
