Changes to SUNDIALS since Release of March 30, 2015.

* Minor corrections and additions to all User Guides.

* Removed Matlab interface from distribution as it has not been updated
  since 2009.  We expect to update this interface soon.

!!!!!!!!!  * _impl file change - Slaven to provide

* In vector API, added new required function, N_VGetVectorID.

* In all packages, example codes were changed from using NV_DATA macro to 
  using N_VGetArrayPpointer_* wen using the nativevectors shipped with
  SUNDIALS

* In all packages, fixed memory leak in banded preconditioner interface.

* In all packages, fixed memory leak in bandpre and bbdpre 'init' routines 
  wherein if the preconditioner is initialized in a loop, previously 
  initialized data was not deleted. 

* Fixed potential memory leak in KLU ReInit functions in all solvers.

* Updated BiCGStab solver to remove redundant dot product call.

* Fixed some examples w.r.t. switch to new macro/function names SUNRexp etc.

* Various minor fixes to installation-related files.

* Added new N_Vector module  which wraps a hypre ParHyp vector and 
  ARKode and CVode examples that use it.

* Added new N_Vector module  which wraps a PETSc vector.

* Corrected name N_VCloneEmptyVectorArray to N_VCloneVectorArrayEmpty in
  all documentation files.

* Revised all usage skeletons to remove references to names specific to
  any particular NVECTOR module, using more general instructions instead.
  This requires some additions to NVECTOR module documentations.

* In sparse matrix module, allow for CSR as well as CSC matrices.

* In KLU interfaces, allow for CSR format matrices.



* In KINSOL, minor bug fix in Picard iteration.

* In KINSOL, minor bug fix in line search.

* In FKINSOL, added FKINCREATE and FKININIT routines to split FKINMALLOC routine
  into two pieces.  FKINMALLOC remains for backward compatibility, but 
  documentation for it has been removed.

* In KINSOL, added kinFoodWeb_kry_omp.c openMP example.



* In ARKode updated linear and mass matrix solvers so that 'free' routines 
  return integer instead of void; updated documentation accordingly.

* In ARKODE, fixed a bug in one Butcher table.

* In ARKODE, fixed error in arkDoErrorTest in recovery after failure.



* In IDA, added idaFoodWeb_kry.c, idaFoodWeb_bnd_omp.c, and idaFoodWeb_kry_omp.c
  examples using openMP.

* Corrected example idaFoodWeb_bnd.c in PrintOutput (wrong component printed).

* In IDA and IDAS, added optional input function IDASetMaxBacksIC to limit
  number of linesearch backtrack operations in IDACalcIC.  User guides
  amended accordingly.



* In IDAS, added idasRoberts_FSA_klu.c, idasRoberts_FSA_sps.c, 
  idasRoberts_ASAi_klu.c, and idasRoberts_ASAi_sps.c sensitivity analysis
  examples using sparse direct solvers.  Also added idasFoodWeb_bnd_omp.c and 
  idasFoobWeb_kry_omp.c openMp examples.

* In IDAS, made SuperLUMT call for backward problem consistent with CVODES.

* In IDAS, added missing backward problem support functions: IDALapackDenseB,
IDALapackDenseFreeB, IDALapackBandB, IDALapackBandFreeB.

* In IDAS, fixed for-loop bugs in IDAAckpntAllocVectors.



* In CVODE, added cvAdvDiff_bnd_omp.c example using openMP.

* In FCVODE, added fcvRoberts_klu.f and fcvRoberts_sps.f fortran
  sparse direct solver examples.

* In FCVODE, fixed argument order bugs in FCVKLU and FCVSUPERLUMT linear 
  solver interfaces.



* In CVODES, aded cvsRoberts_FSA_klu.c, cvsRoberts_FSA_sps.c, 
  cvsRoberts_ASAi_klu.c, cvsRoberts_ASAi_sps.c sparse direct solver examples.
  Also, added cvsAdvDiff_bnd_omp.c openMP example. 
 
* In CVODES, added CVKLUB prototype and corrected CVSuperLUMTB prototype.



* In FKINSOL, FCVODE, and FIDA, added missing Fortran interface routines 
  so that users can supply the sparse Jacobian routine. 

* In CVODES and IDAS changed each **FreeB() to type int; added return(0) 
  to each.


* In CVODES and IDAS header files, corrected documentation of backward
integration  functions, esp. the 'which' argument.

* In KINSOL and ARKODE, updated Anderson acceleration implementation with QR updating.

* In CVODES and IDAS, added ReInit and SetOrdering  wrappers for backward problems.

* In CVODE, IDA, and ARKODE, fixed Fortran interfaces to enable calls to
  *GetErrWeights, *GetEstLocalErrors, and *GetDky within a time step.

* In CVODES and IDAS, in interpolation routines for backward problems,
  added logic to bypass sensitivity interpolation if input sensitivity
  argument is NULL.





* Added "Changes in ..." (latest version) to Intro. in all User Guides.
