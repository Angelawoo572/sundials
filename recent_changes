Changes to SUNDIALS since Release of March 30, 2015.

* Minor corrections and additions to all User Guides.

* In CVODES and IDAS header files, corrected documentation of backward
integration  functions, esp. the 'which' argument.

* In IDAS, added missing backward problem support functions: IDALapackDenseB,
IDALapackDenseFreeB, IDALapackBandB, IDALapackBandFreeB.

* In KINSOL and ARKODE, updated Anderson acceleration implementation with QR updating.

* In CVODES, added CVKLUB prototype and corrected CVSuperLUMTB prototype.

* In IDAS, made SuperLUMT call for backward problem consistent with CVODES.

* In CVODES and IDAS, added ReInit and SetOrdering  wrappers for backward problems.

* Fixed potential memory leak in KLU ReInit functions in all solvers.

* In CVODE, IDA, and ARKODE, fixed Fortran interfaces to enable calls to
*GetErrWeights, *GetEstLocalErrors, and *GetDky.within a time step.

* In ARKODE, fixed a bug in one Butcher table.

* Updated BiCGStab solver to remove redundant dot product call.

* In ARKODE, fixed error in arkDoErrorTest in recovery after failure.

* Fixed some examples w.r.t. switch to new macro/function names SUNRexp etc.

* Various minor fixes to installation-related files.

* In IDAS, fixed for-loop bugs in IDAAckpntAllocVectors.

* Added new N_Vector module ParHyp, and ARKode and CVode example that use it.

* Corrected example idaFoodWeb_bnd.c in PrintOutput (wrong component printed).

* In IDA and IDAS, added optional input function IDASetMaxBacksIC to limit
  number of linesearch backtrack operations in IDACalcIC.  User guides
  amended accordingly.
