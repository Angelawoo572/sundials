\chapter{Providing Alternate Linear Solver Modules}\label{s:new_linsolv}
%===================================================================================
The central {\ida} module interfaces with the linear solver module to be
used by way of calls to four routines.  These are denoted here by 
\id{linit}, \id{lsetup}, \id{lsolve}, and \id{lfree}.
Briefly, their purposes are as follows:
%%
%%
\begin{itemize}
\item \id{linit}: initialize and allocate memory specific to the
  linear solver;
\item \id{lsetup}: evaluate and preprocess the Jacobian or preconditioner;
\item \id{lsolve}: solve the linear system;
\item \id{lfree}: free the linear solver memory.
\end{itemize}
%%
%%
A linear solver module must also provide a user-callable specification routine
(like those described in \S\ref{sss:lin_solv_init}) which will attach the above four 
routines to the main {\ida} memory block. The return value of the specification 
routine should be: \id{SUCCESS} = 0 if the routine was successful,
\id{LMEM\_FAIL} = -1 if a memory allocation failed, or \id{LIN\_ILL\_INPUT} = -2
if some input was illegal.

These four routines that interface between {\ida} and the linear solver module
necessarily have fixed call sequences.  Thus a user wishing to implement another 
linear solver within the {\ida} package must adhere to this set of interfaces.
The following is a complete description of the call list for each of
these routines.  Note that the call list of each routine includes a
pointer to the main {\ida} memory block, by which the routine can access
various data related to the {\ida} solution.  The contents of this memory
block are given in the file \id{ida.h} (but not reproduced here, for
the sake of space).

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{Initialization routine.}
The type definition of \id{linit} is
\usfunction{linit}
{
  int (*linit)(IDAMem IDA\_mem);
}
{
  The purpose of \id{linit} is to complete initializations for      
  specific linear solver, such as counters and statistics.        
}
{
  \begin{args}[IDA\_mem]
  \item[IDA\_mem]
    is the {\ida} memory pointer of type \id{IDAMem}.
  \end{args}
}
{
  An \id{linit} function should return $0$ if it 
  has successfully initialized the {\cvode} linear solver and 
  a negative value otherwise. 
}
{
  If an error does occur, an appropriate message should be sent 
  to \id{IDA\_mem->ida\_errfp}.
}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{Setup routine.} 
The type definition of \id{lsetup} is
\usfunction{lsetup}
{
   int (*lsetup)(&IDAMem IDA\_mem, N\_Vector yyp, N\_Vector ypp,\\
                 &N\_Vector resp,\\
                 &N\_Vector vtemp1, N\_Vector vtemp2, N\_Vector vtemp3); 
}
{
  The job of \id{lsetup} is to prepare the linear solver for subsequent 
  calls to \id{lsolve}. It may re-compute Jacobian-related data is it 
  deems necessary. 
}
{
   \begin{args}[IDA\_mem]
  
   \item[IDA\_mem] 
     is the {\ida} memory pointer of type \id{IDAMem}.
  
   \item[yyp]
     is the predicted $y$ vector for the current {\ida} internal step.
  
   \item[yyp]
     is the predicted $y^\prime$ vector for the current {\ida} internal step.
  
   \item[resp]
     is the value of the residual function at \id{yyp} and \id{ypp}, i.e. $F(t_n, y_{pred}, y_{pred}^\prime)$.
  
   \item[vtemp1] 
   \item[vtemp2]
   \item[vtemp3] 
     are temporary variables of type \id{N\_Vector} provided for use by \id{lsetup}.      
  
   \end{args}
}
{
  The \id{lsetup} routine should return \id{0} if successful,            
  a positive value for a recoverable error, and a negative value  
  for an unrecoverable error.  
}
{}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{Solve routine.}
The type definition of \id{lsolve} is
\usfunction{lsolve}
{
  int (*lsolve)(&IDAMem cv\_mem, N\_Vector b, N\_Vector weight, \\
                &N\_Vector ycur, N\_Vector ypcur, N\_Vector rescur);  
}
{
  The routine \id{lsolve} must solve the linear equation $M x = b$, where         
  $M$ is some approximation to $J = dF/dy + c_j dF/dy^\prime$  
  and the right-hand side vector $b$ is input. 
}
{
  \begin{args}[IDA\_mem]
  \item[IDA\_mem]
    is the {\ida} memory pointer of type \id{IDAMem}.
  \item[b]
    is the right-hand side vector $b$. The solution is to be    
    returned in the vector \id{b}.
  \item[weight]
    is a vector that contains the error weights.
    These are the reciprocals of the $W_i$ of (\ref{e:errwt}).
  \item[ycur]
    is a vector that contains the solver's current approximation to $y(t_n)$.
  \item[ypcur]
    is a vector that contains the solver's current approximation to $y^\prime(t_n)$.
  \item[rescur]
    is a vector that contains $F(t_n,y_{cur},y_{cur}^\prime)$. 
  \end{args}
}
{
  \id{lsolve} returns a positive value    
  for a recoverable error and a negative value for an             
  unrecoverable error. Success is indicated by a \id{0} return value.
}
{}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{Memory deallocation routine.}
The type definition of \id{lfree} is
\usfunction{lfree}
{
  void (*lfree)(IDAMem IDA\_mem);
}
{
  The routine \id{lfree} should free up any memory allocated by the linear
  solver.
}
{
  The argument \id{IDa\_mem} is the {\ida} memory pointer of type \id{IDAMem}.
}
{
  This routine has no return value.
}
{
  This routine is called once a problem has been completed and the 
  linear solver is no longer needed.
}
