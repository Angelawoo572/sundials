\chapter{IDA Installation Procedure}\label{s:install}

The installation of {\ida} is accomplished by installing the
{\sundials} suite as a whole, according to the instructions that
follow.   The same procedure applies whether or not the downloaded
file contains solvers other than {\ida}.
\footnote{Files for both the serial and parallel versions of {\ida}
are included in the distribution.  For users in a serial computing
environment, the files specific to the parallel version may be deleted. 
These files are as follows:
all files in \id{nvec\_par/}; all files in \id{nvec\_spcpar/};
\id{idabbdpre.c, idabbdpre\_impl.h} (in \id{ida/source/});
\id{ida/include/idabbdpre.h}; 
\id{fidabbd.c, fidabbd.h} (in \id{ida/fcmix/});
all files in \id{ida/examples\_par/};
all files in \id{ida/fcmix/examples\_par/}.}
