\chapter{IDA Installation Procedure}\label{s:install}

The installation of {\ida} is accomplished by installing the
{\sundials} suite as a whole, according to the instructions that
follow.   The same procedure applies whether or not the downloaded
file contains solvers other than {\ida}.\footnote{Files for both the
serial and parallel versions of {\ida} are included in the distribution.
For users in a serial computing environment, the files specific to parallel
environments may be deleted.   These files are as follows:
all files in \id{nvec\_par/};
\id{idabbdpre.c, idabbdpre\_impl.h} (in \id{ida/source/});
\id{ida/include/idabbdpre.h}; 
\id{fidabbd.c, fidabbd.h} (in \id{ida/fcmix/});
all files in \id{ida/examples\_par/};
all files in \id{ida/fcmix/examples\_par/}.
(By ``serial version'' of {\ida} we mean the {\ida} solver with the
serial {\nvector} module attached, and similarly for ``parallel version''.)}
