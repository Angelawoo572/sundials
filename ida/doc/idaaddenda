            Solver for Sequential and Parallel Computers"
                          20 December 2001

Since the publication of the IDA User Documentation, several minor
changes have been made in the IDA package.  Only one of those affects
the usage of IDA, as described below.

1. In the initialization routine PVecInitMPI of the parallel NVECTOR
module, the argument comm must be a meaningful communicator of type
MPI_Comm, and cannnot be NULL.

2. In the file llnltyps.h, the default for type 'integer' is now
'long int' instead of 'int'.  The usage instructions in the IDA User 
Documentation for changing this type are to be altered accordingly.

3. The NVECTOR module has been reorganized throughout SUNDIALS. For 
more information, see the file idareadme and the files nvecreadme, 
nvector.h, nvector_serial.h, and nvector_parallel.h in /sundials/shared/.
A serial IDA example must include 'nvector_serial.h' and a parallel IDA
example must include 'nvector_parallel.h'.

4. Both the serial and parallel versions of IDA must now initialize the 
machine environment through calls to M_EnvInit_Serial and M_EnvInit_Parallel
(a rename of PVecInitMPI), respectively. As a consequence, the machine 
environment argument to IDAMalloc (last argument) cannot be NULL anymore
in the serial version.

5. Vector accessor macros now have implementation-dependent names, such
as NV_DATA_S, NV_LENGTH_S, NV_Ith_S for the serial NVECTOR (nvector_serial.h)
and NV_DATA_P, NV_LOCLENGTH_P, NV_GLOBLENGTH_P, NV_Ith_P for the parallel
NVECTOR (nvector_parallel.h).
