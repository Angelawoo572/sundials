       "User Documentation for IDA, A Differential-Algebraic Equation
            Solver for Sequential and Parallel Computers"
                          20 December 2001

Since the publication of the IDA User Documentation, several minor
changes have been made in the IDA package.  Only one of those affects
the usage of IDA, as described below.

1. In the initialization routine PVecInitMPI of the parallel NVECTOR
module, the argument comm must be a meaningful communicator of type
MPI_Comm, and cannnot be NULL.

2. In the file llnltyps.h, the default for type 'integer' is now
'long int' instead of 'int'.  The usage instructions in the IDA User 
Documentation for changing this type are to be altered accordingly.
