idadense.h idadense.c
  - added dimension neq to IDADense (stored in the ls memory struct)
  - removed Neq from call to res
  - simplified Jacobian routine argument list

idaband.h idaband.c
  - added dimension neq to IDABand (stored in the ls memory struct)
  - removed Neq from call to res
  - simplified Jacobian routine argument list

idaspgmr.h idaspgmr.c
  - removed Neq from definitions of IDASpgmrPrecondFn, IDASpgmrPSolveFn, IDASpgmrJtimesFn
  - removed Neq from calls to N_VNew and res
  - compute sqrtN from a dot product now (done in IDASpgmr)
  - work space requirements now use lrw1 and liw1

idabbdpre.h idabbdpre.c
  - removed Neq from definitions of IDABBDPrecond and IDABBDPSolve
  - removed Neq from call to N_VNew

ida.h ida.c
  - removed Neq from definition of ResFn
  - removed Neq from ida_mem      
  - removed Neq from definition of IDAMalloc 
  - removed Neq from all calls to res and N_VNew
  - work space requirements now use N_VSpace to get lrw1 and liw1
  - added IDAGetEwt accessor routine
  - added the following user optional inputs
    max number of Newton iterations (default 3)
    max number of convergence failures (default 10)
    constant in nonlinear solver convergence test (0.33)
    max number of error test failures (default 10)
