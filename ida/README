IDA is a package for the solution of differential-algebraic equation
(DAE) systems.  It is written in C, but derived from the package DASPK
[4,5], which is written in FORTRAN. 

IDA can be used both on serial and parallel (MPI) computers.  The main
difference is in the NVECTOR module of vector kernels.  The desired
version is obtained when compiling the example files by linking the
appropriate library of NVECTOR kernels.  In the parallel version,
communication between processors is done with the MPI (Message Passage
Interface) system.  Throughout this document, we will refer to the
combination of IDA with the serial implementation of the NVECTOR
module as "the serial version of IDA".  Similarly, the combination of
IDA with the parallel implementation of the NVECTOR module will be
called "the parallel version of IDA".

In addition, the available linear system solvers are different.  With
the serial version of IDA, both direct (dense and band) solvers and a
preconditioned Krylov (iterative) solver are available, but in the
parallel version only the Krylov solver is available.  On the other
hand, in addition to the basic solver, the IDA package also contains a
preconditioner module called IDABBDPRE, which provides a
band-block-diagonal preconditioner for use with the parallel version.

IDA is part of a software family called SUNDIALS: SUite of Nonlinear
and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers.  This suite consists of
CVODE, KINSOL, and IDA, and variants of these.  The directory
structure of the package supplied reflects this family relationship.

Several examples problem programs are included, covering both serial
and parallel cases, both small and large problem sizes, and both
linear and nonlinear problems.

The notes below provide the location of documentation, directions for the 
installation of the IDA package, and relevant references. Following that 
is a brief history of revisions to the package.
