                     NVECTOR_PARALLEL
                Release 2.0, November 2004          

MPI parallel implementation of the NVECTOR module for SUNDIALS. 

NVECTOR_PARALLEL defines the content field of N_Vector to be a structure 
containing the global and local lengths of the vector, a pointer to the 
beginning of a contiguous local data array, an MPI communicator, and a 
boolean flag indicating ownership of the data array.

NVECTOR_PARALLEL defines seven macros to provide access to the content of 
a parallel N_Vector, several constructors for vriabls of type N_Vector,
a constructor for an array of variables of type N_Vector, and destructors
for N_Vector and array of N_Vector.

NVECTOR_PARALLEL provides implementations for all vector operations defined
by the generic NVECTOR module in the table of operations.

A. Documentation
----------------
The MPI parallel NVECTOR implementation is fully described in the user documentation 
for any of the SUNDIALS solvers [1,2,3,4]. PostScript and PDF files for the uer guide for 
a particular solver are available in the solver's directory.

B. Installation
---------------

For basic installation instructions see /sundials/INSTALL. 
For complete installation instructions see any of the user guides.

D.1. Revision history since release 1.0 (July 2002)
---------------------------------------------------

- Revised to correspond to new generic NVECTOR module
  (see sundials/shared/README).
- Extended the list of user-callable functions provided by NVECTOR_PARALLEL
  outside the table of vector operations.
- Revised parallel N_VMin and N_VMinQuotient to use BIG_REAL if
  local N is 0 or no quotients found.
- Revised the F/C interface to use underscore flags for name mapping
  and to use precision flag from configure.
- Revised F/C routine NVECTOR names for uniformity.
