1. Determine mathematically "optimal" scaling vector to use for
   right/left preconditioning in our scaled/preconditioned iterative
   linear solvers.  For all but KINSOL, we'd previously been sending
   in the tolerance but no scaling vector so we have no basis of
   comparison from existing code; hence we should figure out the most
   mathematically usable/robust choice.

   * Note: technically, only FGMRES is designed to be used with an
     iterative preconditioner; all the others assume that the
     preconditioner is a *fixed* linear operator.  So it might be that
     we should use sx/sb as the optimal scaling vector, but that the
     preconditioner tolerance should be tighter than the iterative
     linear solver tolerance.

   * Note: if this doesn't make sense mathematically (to supply a
     tolerance and a weight vector), then we should revert the
     PSolveFn function prototype to remove 'w' and 'tol'.

2. Update all solver-specific, user-supplied 'psolve' routine
   interfaces to add the weight vector (and possibly tolerance):
   * header files
   * <solver>_spils files
   * example files
   * documentation
   * release notes

   * Note: if our resolution to 1 above is to remove both 'w' and
     'tol', then still update all solver-specific, user-supplied
     'psolve' routine interfaces to *remove* the tolerance.
