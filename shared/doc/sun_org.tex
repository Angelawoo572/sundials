% This is a shared SUNDIALS TEX file with description of
% the SUNDIALS organization
%
The family of solvers referred to as {\sundials} consists of solvers
{\cvode} (for ODE systems), {\kinsol} (for nonlinear algebraic
systems), and {\ida} (for differential-algebraic systems).  In addition,
variants of these which also do sensitivity analysis calculations are
available or in development. {\cvodes}, an extension of {\cvode} that
provides both forward and adjoint sensitivity capabilities is available,
while {\idas} and {\kinsols} are currently in development.

The various solvers of this family share many subordinate modules.
For this reason, it is organized as a family, with a directory
structure that exploits that sharing (see Fig. \ref{f:sunorg}).

The following is a list of the solver packages presently available:
\begin{itemize}

\item {\cvode},  
  a solver for stiff and nonstiff ODE systems $dy/dt = f(t,y)$;

\item {\cvodes},
  a solver for stiff and nonstiff ODE systems $dy/dt = f(t,y)$
  with sensitivity analysis capabilities;

\item {\kinsol}, 
  a solver for nonlinear algebraic systems $F(u) = 0$;

\item {\ida},
  a solver for differential-algebraic systems $F(t,y,y') = 0$.

\end{itemize}
