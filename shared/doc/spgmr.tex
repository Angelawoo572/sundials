The {\spgmr} package, in the files \id{spgmr.h} and \id{spgmr.c}, includes an
implementation of the scaled preconditioned GMRES\index{GMRES method} method.  
A separate code module, \id{iterative.h} and \id{iterative.c}, contains auxiliary
functions that support {\spgmr}, and also other Krylov solvers to be
added later.  For full details, including usage instructions, see the
files \id{spgmr.h} and \id{iterative.h}.
