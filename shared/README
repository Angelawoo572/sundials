Revision History for NVECTOR and Shared Modules, from 3/21/02           6/23/04

Last log date: 6/18/04


20020321  Defined and implemented generic NVECTOR module, and separate serial/
          parallel NVECTOR modules, including serial/parallel F/C interfaces.
          Modified dense and band backsolve routines to take real* type for
          RHS and solution vector.
          Added initializations for some local variables in spgmr.c.
20020329  Named the DenseMat, BandMat, and SpgmrMemRec structures.
20020626  Changed type names to realtype, integertype,booleantype.
          Renamed llnltypes and llnlmath files.
20030331  Removed length N from N_VNew and N_VMake; added N_VSpace.
          Removed N from SpgmrMalloc call list and SPGMR memory.
20030805  Changed 'machine environment' to 'vector specification'.
20030923  Removed N_VOneMask and added N_VWrmsNormMask from NVECTOR.
20031008  Moved include lines above #ifdef for C++ usage in nvector_**.h
          Renamed iterativ.* as iterative.*
20031118  Set BIG_REAL in sundialstypes.h.
          Revised parallel N_VMin and N_VMinQuotient to use BIG_REAL if
          local N is 0 or no quotients found.
20031211  Revised all F/C modules to use underscore flags for name mapping
          and to use precision flag from configure.
20031222  Added FCFLAGS in NVECTOR makefiles.
20040127  Revised F/C routine NVECTOR names for uniformity.
          Removed UnitRoundoff, using float.h to set this.
20040129  Revised to use SINGLE_PRECISION flag to define MPI real type.
20040205  Removed integertype in favor of long int.
20040302  Removed N_VConstrProdPos.
20040311  Fixed bug in N_VFree_Parallel - possible non-allocated pointer.
20040429  Changed *_GS constants from 0,1 to 1,2 in iterative.*
          Changed file headings to new format.
20040618  Changed realtype* to void* wherever possible in NVECTOR to provide
          more generality for user-defined NVECTOR modules.
