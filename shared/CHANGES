nvector.h nvector.c
  - took out vector dimension from N_VNew and N_VMake
  - removed N_VNew_S and N_VFree_S from ops structure since 
    for any nvector implementation, these routines are the 
    same and should therefore be provided by the generic 
    nvector module.
  - added N_VSpace routine
     
spgmr.h spgmr.c
  - took out N from SpgmrMalloc and spgmr memory structure
