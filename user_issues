Unresolved User Complaints as of 13 March 2013

* Jourdan, 3/29/10. Problems with FCVODE -- related to N type.
  May be OK now, or may still be a problem on 64-bit machines.

* Peter Brown, 5/25/10 and 3/23/11.  With IDA + Matlab, errors in monitor
  function (no yp).  He has found and fixed these himself.
  Also says SundialsTB/IDA (V2.4) does not have monitor function in 1-step
  mode, but did in V2.3.

* Allu, 6/25/10.  IDACalcIC failed; has question.  Most likely user error.
  Waiting for response to my questions.

* Platz, 7/26/10. Unable to compile in 64-bit mode.

* Romanenko, 8/4/10.  Remove static variables in CVODES and IDAS to allow
  multithreading.  (Radu says much more is needed.)

* Amrit, 9/9/10.  Bug suspected in IDASensWrmsNormUpdate -- ewtS not
  initialized.  Bug disputed.  Awaiting response to my request for more
  data (5/19/11, resent 8/3/11).

* Fort, 10/3/10.  Unable to install Fortran library under Windows7.

* Teranishi, 11/23/10.  Wants option to not search for library links.

* John T.G., 2/8/11.  Seg fault in CVodeMonitor -- incompatible w. Matlab.

* Escobar, 2/13/11. Unable to install CVODE on Windows7, 64-bit machine.

* Andersson, 2/23/11.  Suspects bug in CVODES/IDAS checkpointing scheme.
  Says it is not solved with fix reported 11/23/11.  Awaiting more info from him.

* Kandula, 3/8/11.  Getting different results from KINSOL in C vs C++ for
  the same problem.  Awaiting response to request to do more debugging.

* Pitt-Francis, 4/14/11.  Wants Package Version number as an accessible
  constant at compile time.

* Washington, 8/3/11.  In IDAS+Matlab, there is no Matlab interface to get ypS.

* Kaira, 9/1/11.  Failure of code that combines Sundials and Boost.

* Goebbert, 11/3/11.  On web-page (and elsewhere), note that none of the
  solvers are thread-safe (?).

* Abraham, 11/3/11. Would like CVODES to provide adjoint state values at
  specified times, without doing any sensitivity analysis.  Awaiting more input.
  May be partly resolved with use of (newly found) CVodeGetAdjY.

* Er, 7/14/12. Failure to install under Windows/Cmake.

* Stickel, 8/20/12.  Provides fixes to Makefile.in files to make use of the
  DESTDIR option in auto-tools installation.  Fixed already?

* Andersson, 9/12/12. Requesting a feature in CVODES/IDAS to toggle on/off
  sensitivity components, without memory reallocation.

* Andersson, 9/15/12. Proposes a different way to organize the support for
  second-order sensitivity analysis.

* Bogle, 10/5/12. Claims typo on config/SundialsMPIC.cmake.

* Ollivier, 10/8/12. cvRoberts_dns failed to load without BLAS/LAPACK.
  Bug in build files: By default, they add links to BLAS/LAPACK (if found).
  Will change the default.

* Nsing, 10/9/12. How to preserve CVODE forward state during ASA.

* Bogle, 10/9/12. Question re preconditioners based on Domain Decomposition.

* Puech, 10/18/12. Question on libraries to specify.

* Stickel, 10/19/12. KINSOL failed to stop on a negative ier return from user F.

* Barnard, 10/31/12. Question on relative speeds of LAPACK vs CVDense/CVBand.

* Margolis, 11/17/12. Claims CVode gave ewt<=0 return even though all abstol>0.

* Kharche, 11/19/12. Claims CVODE gives solution with wrong sign.

* Nakhimovski, 11/26/12. Claims our CMake files need changes to build Sundials
  under Windows 7 with Visual Studio.

* Nakhimovski, 11/26/12. Asks for guidelines on KINSOL tolerance inputs.

* Todorovski, 12/5/12. Asks for suggestions on CVODE/Java integration.

* Leconte, 3/13/13.  CMake fails under Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express,
