The {\cvode} distribution contains, in the \id{sundials/cvode/examples\_ser}
directory, the following six serial examples (using the {\nvecs} module)
for ODE IVP solution:
\begin{itemize}
\item \id{cvdx}
  solves a chemical kinetics problem consisting of three rate equations.
  
  This program solves the problem with the BDF method, Newton          
  iteration with the {\cvdense} linear solver, and a user-supplied    
  Jacobian routine;
\item \id{cvbx}
  solves the semi-discrete form of an advection-diffusion equation in 2-D. 
  
  This program solves the problem with the BDF method, Newton          
  iteration with the {\cvband} linear solver, and a user-supplied     
  Jacobian routine;
\item \id{cvkx}
  solves the semi-discrete form of a two-species diurnal kinetics
  advection-diffusion PDE system in 2-D space. 

  The problem is solved with the BDF/GMRES method (i.e.    
  using the {\cvspgmr} linear solver) and the block-diagonal part of the  
  Newton matrix as a left preconditioner. A copy of the block-diagonal 
  part of the Jacobian is saved and conditionally reused within the    
  preconditioner setup routine;
\item \id{cvkxb}
  solves the same problem as \id{cvkx}, with the BDF/GMRES method 
  and a banded preconditioner, generated by difference quotients, 
  using the module {\cvbandpre}.
  The problem is solved twice, with left and right preconditioning;
\item \id{cvdemd}
  is a demonstration program for {\cvode} with direct linear solvers.

  Two separate problems are solved using both the Adams and BDF linear
  multistep methods in combination with functional and Newton
  iterations. 

  The first problem is the Van der Pol oscillator for which 
  the Newton iteration cases use the following types of Jacobian approximations:
  (1) dense, user-supplied, (2) dense, difference quotient approximation, 
  (3) diagonal approximation. The second problem is a linear ODE with a
  banded lower triangular matrix derived from a 2-D advection PDE. In this
  case, the Newton iteration cases use the following types of Jacobian
  approximation: (1) band, user-supplied, (2) band, difference       
  quotient approximation, (3) diagonal approximation.
\item \id{cvdemk}
  is a demonstration program for {\cvode} with the Krylov linear solver.

  This program solves a stiff ODE system that arises from a system     
  of partial differential equations.  The PDE system is a six-species
  food web population model, with predator-prey interaction and diffusion 
  on the unit square in two dimensions.

  The ODE system is solved using Newton iteration and the      
  {\cvspgmr} linear solver (scaled preconditioned GMRES).                  
                                                                        
  The preconditioner matrix used is the product of two matrices:         
  (1) a matrix, only defined implicitly, based on a fixed number of     
  Gauss-Seidel iterations using the diffusion terms only; and               
  (2) a block-diagonal matrix based on the partial derivatives of the   
  interaction terms only, using block-grouping.                          
                                                                        
  Four different runs are made for this problem.                        
  The product preconditoner is applied on the left and on the right.    
  In each case, both the modified and classical Gram-Schmidt options    
  are tested;
\end{itemize}

\noindent In the \id{sundials/cvode/examples\_par} directory, the {\cvode} 
distribution contains the following three parallel examples for
IVP integration (using the {\nvecp} module):
\begin{itemize}
\item \id{pvnx}
  solves the semi-discrete form of an advection-diffusion equation in 1-D.

  This program solves the problem with the option for nonstiff systems,
  i.e. Adams method and functional iteration;
\item \id{pvkx}
  is the parallel implementation of \id{cvkx};
\item \id{pvkxb}
  solves the same problem as \id{pvkx}, with the BDF/GMRES method 
  and a block-diagonal matrix with banded blocks as a preconditioner 
  generated by difference quotients, using the module {\cvbbdpre}.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The {\fcvode} module contains, in 
\id{fcmix/examples\_ser} and \id{fcmix/examples\_par}, the following 
examples for the {\F}-{\C} interface:
\begin{itemize}
\item \id{cvdensef} is a serial chemical kinetics example (\id{BDF}/{\dense})
\item \id{cvbandf} is a serial advection-diffusion example (\id{BDF}/{\band})
\item \id{cvkryf} is a serial kinetics-transport example (\id{BDF}/{\spgmr})
\item \id{pvdiagnf} is a parallel diagonal ODE example (\id{ADAMS}/\id{FUNCTIONAL})
\item \id{pvdiagkf} is a parallel diagonal ODE example (\id{BDF}/{\spgmr})
\item \id{pvdiagkbf} is a parallel diagonal ODE example (\id{BDF}/{\spgmr} with 
  {\fcvbbd} preconditioner)
\end{itemize}
