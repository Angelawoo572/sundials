\chapter{CVODE Installation Procedure}\label{s:install}

The installation of {\cvode} is accomplished by installing the
{\sundials} suite as a whole, according to the instructions that
follow.   The same procedure applies whether or not the downloaded
file contains solvers other than {\cvode}.
\footnote{Files for both the serial and parallel versions of {\cvode}
are included in the distribution.  For users in a serial computing
environment, the files specific to the parallel version may be deleted. 
These files are as follows:
all files in \id{nvec\_par/}; all files in \id{nvec\_spcpar/};
\id{cvbbdpre.c, cvbbdpre\_impl.h} (in \id{cvode/source/});
\id{cvode/include/cvbbdpre.h}; 
\id{fcvbbd.c, fcvbbd.h} (in \id{cvode/fcmix/});
all files in \id{cvode/examples\_par/};
all files in \id{cvode/fcmix/examples\_par/}.}
