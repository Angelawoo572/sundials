SUNDIALS Pre-Release Tasks

This is a list of tasks that need to be done before a SUNDIALS release.
The order is bottom-up-- starting with solver source files, and ending with web pages.

1. Bug fixes - C solvers

2. Bug fixes - Matlab

3. Bug fixes - installation

4. Misc. source file fixes

5. Update README file at top level of src/<solver>, with version number, release dates and summary of recent revisions.
    src/arkode/README
    src/cvode/README
    src/cvodes/README
    src/ida/README
    src/idas/README
    src/kinsol/README
    src/nvec_openmp/README
    src/nvec_par/README
    src/nvec_pthreads/README
    src/nvec_ser/README
    src/sundials/README 

6. Update version numbers in source code, documentation, and tarscripts.
    doc/arkode/ARKode_example.tex
    doc/arkode/ARKode.tex
    doc/sundials/ug.tex
    html/main.html
    scripts/tarscript
    sundialsTB/install_STB.m
    CMakeLists.txt
    README
  
6. Create PDF files for SundialsTB
    Create the PDF doc for SundialsTB by running the Matlab program texdoc.m available in sundialsTB/doc.
    The program uses the m2html toolbox, freely available.  It creates doc files in PS and PDF formats as sundialsTB.ps and sundialsTB.pdf.
    Follow Radu's instructions in ????/README

8. Create the tarballs
Create the new distribution tarballs using the "tarscript" shell script under scripts/.  This also compiles the documents (user guides and example
docs) and creates all tarballs in their final form, appropriate for uploading to the website.
