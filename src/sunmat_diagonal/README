                     SUNMATRIX_DIAGONAL
                 released as part of SUNDIALS
    SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers
                   Release 3.0.0, September 2017


Diagonal implementation of the SUNMATRIX module for SUNDIALS. 

SUNMATRIX_DIAGONAL defines the content field of SUNMatrix to be a structure 
containing a single N_Vector, for the diagonal of the matrix.

SUNMATRIX_DIAGONAL defines two macros to provide access to the content of 
a diagonal SUNMatrix, a constructor for variables of type SUNMatrix, and
destructors for SUNMatrix.

SUNMATRIX_DIAGONAL provides implementations for all matrix operations defined
by the generic SUNMATRIX module in the table of operations.
