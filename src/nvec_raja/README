                  released as part of SUNDIALS

                   Release 4.0.0-dev, May 2018


The NVECTOR_RAJA module is an experimental NVECTOR implementation 
with vector kernels written using the RAJA hardware abstraction layer.  

The module allows for SUNDIALS vector kernels to run on GPU devices. 
It is intended for users who are already familiar with RAJA and GPU
programming. Building this vector module requires RAJA to be installed,
as well as a C++ compiler.  

NVECTOR_RAJA defines the content field of an N_Vector to be a 
class Vector, which manages data layout. 

NVECTOR_RAJA defines implementations of all vector operations defined
by the generic NVECTOR module in the table of operations, except for 
N_VSetArrayPointer and N_VGetArrayPointer. As such, this vector is not 
available for use with SUNDIALS Fortran interfaces. When access to raw 
vector data is needed, one should use NVECTOR_RAJA specific functions 
N_VGetHostArrayPointer_Raja and N_VGetDeviceArrayPointer_Raja. Usage
examples of NVECTOR_RAJA are provided in example programs for CVODE.


A. Documentation
----------------

The NVECTOR_RAJA implementation is fully described in the user documentation
for any of the SUNDIALS solvers. A PDF file for the user guide for a particular
solver is available in the solver's subdirectory under doc/.


B. Installation
