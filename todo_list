To Do List for SUNDIALS, as of 11/16/12

Develop a set of unit tests for the vector kernel operations.  This 
set of tests should be somethign a user could employ to verify 
their own vector kernel is correct.  (Of course, ours shoudl pass these
tests!)

Make build system handling of examples consistent.  Right now, distclean
does not remove compiled examples.  Also, the install builds an examples
directory, but the executabels are not copied there.
