\subsection{MPI communicator type wrapper}

As a convenience, {\sundials} provides a wrapper for MPI communicator type
\id{SUNMPI\_Comm}. If {\sundials} is built with MPI support, \id{SUNMPI\_Comm}
will be set to \id{MPI\_Comm}, otherwise it will be set to \id{int} type.
This is intended primarily intended for internal use within {\sundials}
libraries. Users may find it helpful when writing code that can be linked
to both, single-node and MPI-enabled {\sundials} libraries.
