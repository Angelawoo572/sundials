{\sundials} provides some linear solvers only as a means for 
users to get problems running and not as highly efficient solvers.
In particular, the dense and band direct solvers are not nearly as efficient as
their LaPACK counterparts, and users are encouraged to use LaPACK solvers
if an efficient dense direct solver is needed.
Table \ref{t:solver-vector} shows the linear solver interfaces
available in {\sundials} packages and the vector implementations
required for use.  As an example, one cannot use the {\sundials} package
specific dense direct
solver interfaces  with the \mpi-based vector implementation.  However, 
as discussed in Chapter \ref{s:gen_linsolv} the direct dense, direct band, 
and iterative spils solvers provided with
{\sundials} are written in a way that allows a user to develop 
their own solvers around them should a user so deire.
