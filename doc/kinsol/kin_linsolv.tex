\chapter{General Use Linear Solver Components in SUNDIALS}\label{s:gen_linsolv}
%===================================================================================
In this chapter, we describe linear solver components
included in {\sundials} which are of potential use as generic packages in
themselves, either in conjunction with the use of {\kinsol} or separately.
