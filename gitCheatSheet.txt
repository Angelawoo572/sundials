
               Cheat Sheet for git - 06 December 2016


1. One-time setup of ssh keys (to avoid needing password with each repo transaction).
    
    [Taken from: https://myconfluence.llnl.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=99844309]
   
    Create your ssh key using the ssh-keygen utility:
    skip this first command if you already have a public/private ssh key
    (i.e. you already have an id_rsa.pub file in your ~/.ssh directory))

      > ssh-keygen -t rsa


    Make sure that your ssh directory (~/.ssh) is readable only by you.
      > chmod -R go-rwx ~/.ssh

    Copy the ssh key to any other machines that you want to be able to SSH to:
      > ssh-copy-id <destination host name>

    Install the key in Stash:
     Login to http://mystash.llnl.gov
     Click on the profile drop down in the far top right of the window and select "Manage Account"
     Click on the "SSH keys" link on the left of the screen and then "Add key".
     Paste your key into the text box. The text of the key is the contents of the file "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

2: Tell git who you are:
      > git config --global user.email "yourname@example.com"
      > git config --global user.name "Your Name"

3: Clone the repository:
      > git clone ssh://git@mystash.llnl.gov:7999/sundials/sunrepo.git
    by default, you will be on the 'develop' branch

TYPICAL WORKFLOW: see https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow

Note: When creating a branch on which to work, please name it with either "Feature" or "Bugfix"
followed by a short, descriptive name, i.e. "BugFix_IDAheader".

1: Start working on a feature branch do one of the following:
  a) To work on an existing branch, checkout specific branch to work on:
      > git checkout <branchname>

  ---OR---

  a) Create a new branch based on the 'develop' branch
      > git checkout -b <branchname> develop

  [ NOTE: You cannot work directly on 'master' or 'develop' branches as 
    you are not allowed to push to them. You must branch from 'develop' 
    and create pull request to merge back into 'develop'   ]

  b) Push the new branch up to the central repo
      > git push -u origin <branchname>

2: Modify Files (edit, add, etc)

  a) Periodically ensure that you are up-to-date with all desired remote branches
      > git pull --rebase origin <remotebranch>

  [ NOTE: your local changes must be committed prior to rebase (see step 3)]
  [ ALSO NOTE: do above for each branch in which you need any remote modifications ]

  b) If there are conflicts (git will tell you), use 'git status' for more info:
      > git status

    b1) Edit file(s) to resolve any conflicts, then stage
        > git add <path/filename>

    b2) Continue with rebase to bring local current with remote
        > git rebase --continue <remotebranch>

  c) Edit files

3: Commit locally (commits all staged files)
      > git commit -m "my commit comment" -a

  [ NOTE: This can also be done while iterating in Step 2 above ]

4: Push commited changes to remote repo (defaults to your current branch):
      > git push origin <branchname>

5: Create pull request to have your branch changes reviewed/merged into target branch
  a) Browse to https://mystash.llnl.gov/projects/SUNDIALS/repos/sunrepo/browse
  b) Click on left branch icon
  c) Click on your branch - you'll see a 'Compare' screen that lets you pick a branch (source on top)
     to merge with another branch (target on bottom) and shows the current differences 
  d) Select desired branches and click 'Create pull request' button
  e) Edit title of pull request (defaults to branch name), add a description, and select Reviewers
     that can approve the request.
  f) Click 'Create' button

HELPFUL COMMANDS:

1: List all branches (and show *current branch)
      > git branch

2: Push branch to remote repository:
      > git push origin <branchname>

3: List files you've changed and still need to add or commit:
      > git status

4: Merge different branch to your 'active' branch:
      > git merge <branchname>

5: See differences in local file vs remote file:
      > git diff <filename>

6: Abandon local changes to a file and get previously commited version
      > git checkout <filename>
