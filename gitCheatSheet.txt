1. One-time setup of ssh keys (to avoid needing password with each repo transaction).
    
    [Taken from: https://myconfluence.llnl.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=99844309]
   
    Create your ssh key using the ssh-keygen utility:
    skip this first command if you already have a public/private ssh key
    (i.e. you already have an id_rsa.pub file in your ~/.ssh directory))

      > ssh-keygen -t rsa


    Make sure that your ssh directory (~/.ssh) is readable only by you.
      > chmod -R go-rwx ~/.ssh

    Copy the ssh key to any other machines that you want to be able to SSH to:
      > ssh-copy-id <destination host name>

    Install the key in Stash:
     Login to http://mystash.llnl.gov
     Click on the profile drop down in the far top right of the window and select "Manage Account"
     Click on the "SSH keys" link on the left of the screen and then "Add key".
     Paste your key into the text box. The text of the key is the contents of the file "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

2: Tell git who you are:
      > git config --global user.email "yourname@example.com"
      > git config --global user.name "Your Name"

3: Clone the repository:
      > git clone ssh://git@mystash.llnl.gov:7999/sundials/sunrepo.git
    by default, you will be on the 'master' branch

TYPICAL WORKFLOW: see https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow

1: Start working on a feature branch do one of the following:
  a) To work on an existing branch, checkout pecific branch to work on:
      > git checkout <branchname>
  OR

  b) Create a new branch based on the develop branch
      > git checkout -b <branchname> develop

2: Modify Files (edit, add, etc)

3: Stage file to be added to the repo
      > git add <path/filename>

4: Commit locally (commits all staged files)
      > git commit -m "my commit comment"

5: Ensure you have any/all changes from remote repo (for your current branch)
      > git pull --rebase

6: Push commited changes to remote repo (for your current branch):
      > git push

7: Create pull request to have your branch changes merged into develop branch

HELPFUL COMMANDS:

1: List all branches (and show *current branch)
      > git branch

2: Push branch to remote repository:
      > git push origin <branchname>

3: List files you've changed and still need to add or commit:
      > git status

4: Merge different branch to your 'active' branch:
      > git merge <branchname>


5: See differences in local file vs remote file:
      > git diff <filename>
