KINSOL is a solver for nonlinear algebraic systems which can be
described as F(u) = 0. It is newly rewritten in the C language, based
on the previous Fortran package NKSOL [1]. The original Fortran was
written by Brown and Saad.  In addition to the basic solver, this
package includes a module called KINBBDPRE, which provides a
band-block-diagonal preconditioner for the parallel version.

KINSOL can be used both on serial and parallel (MPI) computers.
The difference is only in the NVECTOR module of vector kernels.
The desired version is obtained when compiling the example files
by linking the appropriate library of NVECTOR kernels. In the parallel 
version, communication between processors is done with the MPI 
(Message Passage Interface) system.

Throughout this document, we will refer to the combination of KINSOL with
the serial implementation of the NVECTOR module as "the serial version
of KINSOL". Similarly, the combination of KINSOL with the parallel 
implementation of the NVECTOR module will be called "the parallel version 
of KINSOL". Note that the KINSOL package also contains a preconditioner 
module called KINBBDPRE, which provides a band-block-diagonal preconditioner 
for use with the parallel version only.

KINSOL is part of a software family called SUNDIALS: SUite of Nonlinear
and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers.  This suite consists of
CVODE, KINSOL, and IDA, and variants of these.  The directory
structure of the package supplied reflects this family relationship.

Several examples are included, all of which have been run on systems
at LLNL.  The parallel tests were done on the Cray T3D used the EPCC
MPI library while those done on the CASC Sun Sparc cluster used the
MPICH library.  Using KINSOL on a different system should require only
minor modifications to makefiles, as described below.

For use with Fortran applications, a set of Fortran/C interface routines,
called FKINSOL, is also supplied.  These are written in C, but assume that
the user calling program and all user-supplied routines are in Fortran.

The notes below provide instructions for the installation of the
KINSOL package.  In the package supplied, each Makefile is set up so
that typing 'make' produces instructions for various make operations
available.  For convenience, we include here a brief summary of the
usage of KINSOL in a C application (without use of KINBBDPRE), with
notes on the locations of full user documentation.  Following that is
a list of references and a brief history of revisions to the package.


A. Installation Notes for KINSOL
--------------------------------

1. A tar file kinsol.tar is provided.  To un-tar, type 'tar xvf kinsol.tar'
   in an appropriate working directory.  This generates a directory called
   /sundials/, with subdirectories /shared/, /kinsol/, /include/, and /lib/.

2. /sundials/kinsol/doc/ contains this file, kinreadme, a PostScript file
   kinudoc.ps for the KINSOL user documentation [2], and a file
   kinaddenda with corrections to the usage as given in [2].

3. /sundials/shared/ contains files (header and source) that are shared
   with other members of SUNDIALS. Typing 'make lib' in /sundials/shared/source
   generates a library file /sundials/shared/lib/libshared.***.a (where *** 
   is a machine dependent identifier), creates a symbolic link to this library in 
   /sundials/lib/ and symbolic links to the SHARED header files in
   /sundials/include/, then removes the object files.

4. /sundials/kinsol/source/ contains source files for KINSOL, and a makefile.
   Typing 'make lib' there compiles generates a library
   file /sundials/kinsol/lib/libkinsol.***.a (where *** is a machine
   dependent identifier), creates a symbolic link to this library in 
   /sundials/lib/ and symbolic links to the KINSOL header files in
   /sundials/include/, then removes the object files.

5. /sundials/kinsol/include/ contains all required header files for KINSOL.

6. /sundials/kinsol/examples/ contains three example programs, and a
   makefile.  The three programs -- kinxs, kinxp, and kinxbbd --
   each solve a predator-prey PDE system example problem.  
   (a) kinxs is a serial program, using a block-diagonal preconditioner.
   (b) kinxp is a parallel program, using a block-diagonal preconditioner.
   (c) kinxbbd is a parallel program, using the band-block-diagonal
       conditioner module KINBBDPRE.
     In all three examples, as the output from a large system such as
   these could be overwhelming, only the states for the 'bottom left'
   and 'top right' corners of the computational grid are printed.
   See the initial comments in each example source file for details on
   problem and solution parameters.   
      Typing 'make <ex>' in this subdirectory, where <ex> is kinxs, kinxp,
   or kinxbbd, finds the required header files etc. and generates the
   corresponding executable file.  Also included are sample outputs
   for the examples (with names ending in .out).  Outputs obtained by
   another user (and run with the same number of processors) should agree
   with these, possibly with relatively small differences throughout.

7. /sundials/kinsol/fcmix/ contains FKINSOL, package of Fortran/C interfaces
   which allow a Fortran application to use KINSOL.  A makefile is supplied.
   Typing 'make lib' adds the FKINSOL object files to the KINSOL library
   in /sundials/kinsol/lib/. Note that the KINSOL library must have been
   created before this.
      Usage documentation for FKINSOL is contained in [2], and also in
   the files fkinsol.h and fkinbbd.h (for use of KINSOL without and with
   KINBBDPRE, respectively).  The header file fcmixpar.h 
   (in /sundials/shared/include/) contains two machine-dependent parameters 
   that are used to define interface function names.  Check, and if necessary 
   modify, those parameter values for a given machine.
      The subdirectory /sundials/kinsol/fcmix/ also contains two Fortran
   examples, called kindiagsf and kindiagpf.  Type 'make fkinx_ser' or
   'make fkinx_par' to compile these examples.  A sample output for
   each is included.
      Note: the example programs are in double precision Fortran; for a
   long-wordlength machine, these should be converted to single precision.

8. Installing and using KINSOL in a different environment requires only
   minor modifications to the various makefiles.  For the compilation of
   KINSOL, check the file Makefile in /sundials/kinsol/source/,
   and if necessary modify the compiler name and flags, and the path to 
   MPI include files.
      To run KINSOL on an application in a different directory location,
   the makefiles in /sundials/kinsol/examples/ can be used with minor
   changes.  In the files Makefile, kinx_ser.mk, and kinx_par.mk, correct
   the various paths involved -- path to the top of the SUNDIALS tree 
   and to MPI include files.
   Also check and correct the compiler/linker names and flags.
   Similar remarks apply to the use of FKINSOL.


B.  Summary of Parallel Usage of KINSOL
---------------------------------------

    #include "nvector_parallel"

0.  msgfile = fopen("test.out","w");  /*  Open message file , if desired.
                                          see #5, below */

1.  MPI_Init();  /* As M_EnvInit_Parallel also calls MPI_Init, this call is only
		            required if the user's program uses MPI before step 3 */

2.  Set local length n, global length Neq, and active set of processors

3.  machEnv = M_EnvInit_Parallel(comm, n, Neq, &argc, &argv);
      /* comm = MPI communicator (if set up by user), or
         comm = MPI_COMM_WORLD (specifying all processors) */
    if (machEnv == NULL) return(1);
    ...

4.  NV_MAKE_P(u, udata, machEnv);   /* macro defined in nvector_parallel.h */     
      or
    u = N_VNew(Neq, machEnv);       /* user sets up vectors, etc. */
    ...

5.  mem = KINMalloc( Neq, msgfile, machEnv);      /* initializes KINSOL */
    if (mem == NULL) return(1); 
    /* if stdout is to be used instead of a specific error message file, 
       enter NULL in place of msgfile */
    ...

6.  flag = KIN<linear solver choice> 
    /* e.g. KINSpgmr(... Precond, Psolve,...)
       call the setup routine for the linear solver to be used--
       however, only KINSpgmr is available to date.
       Test flag for a successful call (0 means OK). */
    ...

7.  flag= KINSol(mem, Neq, u, func, ... , machEnv);
    /* call the KINSOL main routine -- can be called repetitively with
       different functions func and other options. The linear solver
       choice made in step 6, however, cannot be changed between 
       KINSol calls. Instead, a KINFree and KINSpgmr call are required 
       Test flag for a successful call (1 or 2 means OK).*/
    ...

8.  KINFree(mem);       /* Free KINSOL memory independent of machine */
    ...

9.  M_EnvFree_Parallel(machEnv);     /* Free machine-dependent stuff */

Usage Notes:

(1) See [2] and the kinaddenda file for detailed user documentation. 

(2) See the file nvector_parallel.h for documentation of M_EnvInit_Parallel, 
    M_EnvFree_Parallel, and NV_MAKE_P (steps 3, 4, 9).

(3) For further assistance with usage, see the example programs kinxs.c
    and kinxp.c, which are heavily annotated.
