\chapter{Generic Linear Solvers in SUNDIALS}\label{s:gen_linsolv}
%===================================================================================
In this section, we describe three generic linear solver code modules that 
are included in {\sundials}, but which are of potential use as generic packages in
themselves, either in conjunction with the use of {\kinsol} or separately.
These modules are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The {\spgmr} package, which includes a solver for the scaled
      preconditioned GMRES method.
\end{itemize}

For the sake of space, the functions for \id{DenseMat} and
\id{BandMat} matrices and the functions in {\spgmr} are only summarized
briefly, since they are less likely to be of direct use in connection
with {\kinsol}.  The functions for small dense matrices are fully
described, because we expect that they will be useful in the
implementation of preconditioners used with the combination of {\kinsol}
and the {\kinspgmr} solver.
