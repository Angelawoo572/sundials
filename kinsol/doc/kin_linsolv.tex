\chapter{Generic Linear Solvers in SUNDIALS}\label{s:gen_linsolv}
%===================================================================================
In this chapter, we describe four generic linear solver code modules that 
are included in {\sundials}, but which are of potential use as generic packages in
themselves, either in conjunction with the use of {\kinsol} or separately.
These modules are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The {\dense} matrix package, which includes functions
      for small dense matrices treated as simple array types.
\item The {\spgmr} package, which includes a solver for the scaled
      preconditioned GMRES method.
\item The {\spbcg} package, which includes a solver for the scaled
      preconditioned Bi-CGStab method.
\item The {\sptfqmr} package, which includes a solver for the scaled
      preconditioned TFQMR method.
\end{itemize}

The functions for small dense matrices are fully
described here because we expect that they will be useful in the
implementation of preconditioners used with the combination of {\kinsol}
and the {\kinspgmr}, {\kinspbcg} or {\kinsptfqmr} solver.
