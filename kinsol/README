KINSOL is a solver for nonlinear algebraic systems which can be
described as F(u) = 0.  It is newly rewritten in the C language, based
on the previous Fortran package NKSOL [4]. The original Fortran was
written by Brown and Saad.  In addition to the basic solver, this
package includes a module called KINBBDPRE, which provides a
band-block-diagonal preconditioner for the parallel version.

KINSOL can be used both on serial and parallel (MPI) computers.
The difference is only in the NVECTOR module of vector kernels.
The desired version is obtained when compiling the example files
by linking the appropriate library of NVECTOR kernels.  In the parallel 
version, communication between processors is done with the MPI 
(Message Passage Interface) system.

Throughout this document, we will refer to the combination of KINSOL with
the serial implementation of the NVECTOR module as "the serial version
of KINSOL".  Similarly, the combination of KINSOL with the parallel 
implementation of the NVECTOR module will be called "the parallel version 
of KINSOL".  Note that the KINSOL package also contains a preconditioner 
module called KINBBDPRE, which provides a band-block-diagonal preconditioner 
for use with the parallel version only.

KINSOL is part of a software family called SUNDIALS: SUite of Nonlinear
and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers.  This suite consists of
CVODE, KINSOL, and IDA, and variants of these.  The directory
structure of the package supplied reflects this family relationship.

For use with Fortran applications, a set of Fortran/C interface routines,
called FKINSOL, is also supplied.  These are written in C, but assume that
the user calling program and all user-supplied routines are in Fortran.

The notes below provide the location of documentation, directions for the 
installation of the KINSOL package, and relevant references. Following that 
is a brief history of revisions to the package.
