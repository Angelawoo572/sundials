<pre>Hi, Radu.

Thanks very much for your thoughtful response, including the background
material which describes our situation exactly, with the minor exception
that our constraint matrix G is usually not full rank. 

When Dan Rosenthal and I were working on this problem with Linda in the
early 1990s, stabilized index 2 was one of her first suggestions and we
spent a lot of time trying to get it to work (using Dassl on the index 2
problem). Our conclusion at the time was that the method, though elegant in
theory, doesn't work well in practice. It is hard to construct large scale,
poorly conditioned, stiff mechanical problems so the literature tends to
draw conclusions from small examples (7-body linkages, e.g.) which in my
experience are unwarranted in general (200-body vehicles, or 500-body
polymers, e.g.).

As a result of this difficulty we explored all the methods we could find in
the literature of the time (mostly from Hairer, Ascher, Chin, Reich &amp;
Petzold). We were fortunate to have on hand a huge collection of large-scale
mechanical systems of great practical interest. On these problems, many
methods that worked well on average exhibited unacceptable worst-case
behavior. Coordinate projection, on the other hand, worked well in all cases
and was dramatically better than anything else we tried. I have used
coordinate projection ever since both for mechanical problems and large
molecule simulations and have been very satisfied with it.

The ability to treat the system as an ODE is a huge strength of the method
(which it shares with the awkward Baumgarte stabilization scheme). That
allows one to choose from a wide variety of integration methods, and deal
with the essentially minor issue of constraint stabilization with a minor
correction to the method rather than a complete restructuring of the
problem.

At the moment I think CVODE is the best ODE method for our problems and I
would very much like to be able to use it. Any advice you can offer would be
greatly appreciated. Otherwise we'll probably bolt in some crummy one-step
scheme while working up the courage to peek under the CVODE hood!

Best regards,
Sherm

[<a  href="mailto:owner-sundials-users@lists.llnl.gov">mailto:owner-sundials-users@lists.llnl.gov</a>] On Behalf Of Radu Serban

Subject: Re: [sundials-users] coordinate projection with CVODE

Hi Sherm,

The short answer is no, you cannot use coordinate projection without
modifying CVODE (probably quite substantially). From this point of 
view, CVODE is really the same as &quot;DASSL in ODE mode&quot;. With any adaptive
multistep integrator, you need to basically replace the underlying 
nonlinear solver so that the Nordsieck history array contains projected
values from past timesteps. We have been thinking of ways of 
&quot;decoupling&quot; the nonlinear solver, as we do with the linear solvers, in the
SUNDIALS solvers (which would allow the user to provide their 
own), but that is no easy task.

In any case (as you have experienced with DASSL), it is non-trivial to
implement the explicit projection that you describe in any BDF solver 
with order and stepsize control. However, your problem is not a generic ODE
with invariants, but rather an index-3 DAE of multibody rigid 
dynamics, so you can take advantage of that. My suggestion is to use a
different formulation - stabilized index-2 (or Gear-Gupta-Leimkuhler) 
- that contains implicitly the projection on the constraint manifold. The
resulting index-2 DAE can then be solved robustly and efficiently 
with a BDF solver (you'll need the IDA solver though). Granted, in this
formulation, the problem size is increased with additional Lagrange 
multipliers, but that should be no major show-stopper in your case since, as
you indicate, your problems have a modest number of constraints.

Is there any reason why you do not want to use the stabilized index-2
formulation? I'm not sure if SimTK can directly provide the constraint 
Jacobian needed to put together the additional correction term, but even if
it cannot, an approximation to this Jacobian can be extracted 
from the DAE Jacobian used in IDA.

Since we are having this discussion on the sundials-users forum and I'm not
sure how many of our users are familiar with multibody dynamics, 
to allow everybody to follow this, I gave the actual index-3 DAE for
multibody dynamics below.

If q are (any) generalized coordinates constrained by g(q)=0 (your equation
2 below where, for simplicity, I only consider scleronomic 
constraints; i.e. no explicit time dependence), and v=q' are the generalized
velocities, then the index-3 DAEs are

(1)   Mq'' = f(t,q,q') - G^T * l
(2)   0 = g(q)

or, in first order form

(1')   q' = v
(1'')  Mv' = f(t,q,v) - G^T * l
(2)    0 = g(q)

where G is the Jacobian of the constraints g, G^T is its transpose, and l is
a vector of Lagrange multipliers. M is a generalized mass 
matrix (usually non-singular, in particular when using relative coordinates
as you do) and f is a vector of generalized external forces. 
G^T*l represent constraint forces; i.e. the forces that restrict the system
to evolve on the manifold defined by g.

Taking successive differentiations of the algebraic constraint equations
0=g(q), we get the so-called hidden constraints, namely

velocity constraint:     (3)  0 = G * v
acceleration constraint: (4)  0 = G * v' + v^T * G_q * v

where G_q is a tensor (G_q=d2g/dq2).

If G has full rank (i.e. there are no redundant constraints), one can solve
Eqs. (1)+(4) for the Lagrange multipliers l and substitute them 
back into (1) to obtain your first equation below.

The stabilized index-2 formulation considers the position and velocity
constraints (2) and (3) simultaneously and includes a correction term 
at the velocity level (in terms of additional Lagrange multipliers - m),
resulting in the following index-2 DAE:

   q' = v - G^T * m
   Mv' = f(t,q,v) - G^T * l
   0 = g(q)
   0 = G * v

This system can be solved directly by IDA. Note that the correction term
vanishes identically for the analytical solution (m=0) and remains 
of the size of the prescribed tolerances for the numerical solution.
