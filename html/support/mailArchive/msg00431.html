<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi Sherm,</pre><br>
I don't know what to say, I haven't personally tried the stabilized index-2 formulation on very large systems. However, the version of DASSL 
 that you've tried it with didn't have some features that DASPK3.0 and IDA now have (such as the option of excluding the algebraic 
variables from the error test - which you may have tried with Linda at that time). My point is that it shouldn't be all that difficult to 
reconsider it and try it with IDA.<br>
<br>
Moreover, knowing that MSC.Adams has this formulation as an option, I called a friend of mine who used to work for them. He told me that the 
stabilized index-2 formulation never gave them problems and, as a matter of fact, is the default formulation in Adams/Engine precisely 
because they found it is more accurate and stable! The only reason why it is not the default in the other Adams products is only because 
this formulation is a bit more expensive (due to the increased number of variables and equations) and their typical users prefer faster 
solutions.<br>
<br>
I'm certainly not advocating this formulation over others. My point is that it'd be much easier to change the formulation rather than the 
solver. However, if this formulation indeed does not work well for real-life problems than modifying CVODE may be the only way to go. But 
that's no mean feat and would result in a solver that will not benefit from future SUNDIALS developments...<br>

Thanks very much for your thoughtful response, including the background<br>
material which describes our situation exactly, with the minor exception<br>
that our constraint matrix G is usually not full rank. <br>
<br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">When Dan Rosenthal and I were working on this problem with Linda in the
early 1990s, stabilized index 2 was one of her first suggestions and we
spent a lot of time trying to get it to work (using Dassl on the index 2
problem). Our conclusion at the time was that the method, though elegant in
theory, doesn't work well in practice. It is hard to construct large scale,
poorly conditioned, stiff mechanical problems so the literature tends to
draw conclusions from small examples (7-body linkages, e.g.) which in my
experience are unwarranted in general (200-body vehicles, or 500-body
polymers, e.g.).</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">As a result of this difficulty we explored all the methods we could find in
the literature of the time (mostly from Hairer, Ascher, Chin, Reich &amp;
Petzold). We were fortunate to have on hand a huge collection of large-scale
mechanical systems of great practical interest. On these problems, many
methods that worked well on average exhibited unacceptable worst-case
behavior. Coordinate projection, on the other hand, worked well in all cases
and was dramatically better than anything else we tried. I have used
coordinate projection ever since both for mechanical problems and large
molecule simulations and have been very satisfied with it.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">The ability to treat the system as an ODE is a huge strength of the method
(which it shares with the awkward Baumgarte stabilization scheme). That
allows one to choose from a wide variety of integration methods, and deal
with the essentially minor issue of constraint stabilization with a minor
correction to the method rather than a complete restructuring of the
problem.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">At the moment I think CVODE is the best ODE method for our problems and I
would very much like to be able to use it. Any advice you can offer would be
greatly appreciated. Otherwise we'll probably bolt in some crummy one-step
scheme while working up the courage to peek under the CVODE hood!</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Best regards,
Sherm</pre><br>

<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi Sherm,</pre><br>
The short answer is no, you cannot use coordinate projection without<br>
modifying CVODE (probably quite substantially). From this point of 
view, CVODE is really the same as &quot;DASSL in ODE mode&quot;. With any adaptive<br>
multistep integrator, you need to basically replace the underlying 
nonlinear solver so that the Nordsieck history array contains projected<br>
values from past timesteps. We have been thinking of ways of 
&quot;decoupling&quot; the nonlinear solver, as we do with the linear solvers, in the<br>
SUNDIALS solvers (which would allow the user to provide their 
own), but that is no easy task.<br>
<br>
In any case (as you have experienced with DASSL), it is non-trivial to<br>
implement the explicit projection that you describe in any BDF solver 
with order and stepsize control. However, your problem is not a generic ODE<br>
with invariants, but rather an index-3 DAE of multibody rigid 
dynamics, so you can take advantage of that. My suggestion is to use a<br>
different formulation - stabilized index-2 (or Gear-Gupta-Leimkuhler) 
- that contains implicitly the projection on the constraint manifold. The<br>
resulting index-2 DAE can then be solved robustly and efficiently 
with a BDF solver (you'll need the IDA solver though). Granted, in this<br>
formulation, the problem size is increased with additional Lagrange 
multipliers, but that should be no major show-stopper in your case since, as<br>
you indicate, your problems have a modest number of constraints.<br>
<br>
Is there any reason why you do not want to use the stabilized index-2<br>
formulation? I'm not sure if SimTK can directly provide the constraint 
Jacobian needed to put together the additional correction term, but even if<br>
it cannot, an approximation to this Jacobian can be extracted 
from the DAE Jacobian used in IDA.<br>
<br>
Since we are having this discussion on the sundials-users forum and I'm not<br>
sure how many of our users are familiar with multibody dynamics, 
to allow everybody to follow this, I gave the actual index-3 DAE for<br>
multibody dynamics below.<br>
<br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">--Radu</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;"><br></pre><br>
<br>If q are (any) generalized coordinates constrained by g(q)=0 (your equation<br>
2 below where, for simplicity, I only consider scleronomic 
constraints; i.e. no explicit time dependence), and v=q' are the generalized<br>
velocities, then the index-3 DAEs are<br>
<br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">(1)   Mq'' = f(t,q,q') - G^T * l
(2)   0 = g(q)</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">or, in first order form</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">(1')   q' = v
(1'')  Mv' = f(t,q,v) - G^T * l
(2)    0 = g(q)</pre><br>
where G is the Jacobian of the constraints g, G^T is its transpose, and l is<br>
a vector of Lagrange multipliers. M is a generalized mass 
matrix (usually non-singular, in particular when using relative coordinates<br>
as you do) and f is a vector of generalized external forces. 
G^T*l represent constraint forces; i.e. the forces that restrict the system<br>
to evolve on the manifold defined by g.<br>
<br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Taking successive differentiations of the algebraic constraint equations
0=g(q), we get the so-called hidden constraints, namely</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">velocity constraint:     (3)  0 = G * v
acceleration constraint: (4)  0 = G * v' + v^T * G_q * v</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">where G_q is a tensor (G_q=d2g/dq2).</pre><br>
If G has full rank (i.e. there are no redundant constraints), one can solve<br>
Eqs. (1)+(4) for the Lagrange multipliers l and substitute them 
back into (1) to obtain your first equation below.<br>
<br>
The stabilized index-2 formulation considers the position and velocity<br>
constraints (2) and (3) simultaneously and includes a correction term 
at the velocity level (in terms of additional Lagrange multipliers - m),<br>
resulting in the following index-2 DAE:<br>
<br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">   q' = v - G^T * m
   Mv' = f(t,q,v) - G^T * l
   0 = g(q)
   0 = G * v</pre><br>
This system can be solved directly by IDA. Note that the correction term<br>
vanishes identically for the analytical solution (m=0) and remains 
of the size of the prescribed tolerances for the numerical solution.<br>

<pre style="margin: 0em;">The coordinate projection integration step procedure is:

   4 the new (q,q') is the end-of-step result
   5 final value of the derivative is f(t+h,q,q')
As long as the projections are done normal to the manifolds, this is
guaranteed not to damage the solution accuracy, and usually improves it.
