SUNDIALS: SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers

The family of solvers referred to as SUNDIALS consists of solvers
CVODE (for ODE systems), KINSOL (for nonlinear algebraic systems), 
and IDA (for differential-algebraic systems).  
In addition, variants of these which also do sensitivity analysis 
calculations are in development.

The various solvers of this family share many subordinate modules.
For this reason, it is organized as a family, with a directory
structure that exploits that sharing.  However, tar-files for
individual solvers can be built and are being distributed, as well as
a tar-file for all solvers released to date, called sundials.tar.
Each individual solver includes documentation on installation, along
with full usage documentation.

The following is a list of the solver packages presently available,
along with the corresponding tar-file name, and the path and name of
the installation documentation file.

CVODE:  A solver for stiff and nonstiff ODE systems dy/dt = f(t,y),
        with serial and parallel versions.

KINSOL: A solver for nonlinear algebraic systems F(u) = 0, with serial
        and parallel versions.

IDA:    A solver for differential-algebraic systems F(t,y,y') = 0, with
        serial and parallel versions.

CVODES: A solver for stiff and non-stiff ODE systems with sensitivity
        analysis capabilities, with serial and parallel versions.

Warning to users who receive more than one of these individual solvers
at different times: The mixing of old and new versions SUNDIALS may fail.  
To avoid such failures, obtain all desired solvers at the same time.

For installation directions see the file INSTALL.
